# Customer-Analysis
This project will analyze if a customer will return based on the variables fed in the ML algorithm.got 

## Scope
- We will clean the data, Perform an EDA, create a machine learning model that will predict if someone will return or not after a purchase. A dashboard will be created using Streamlit for same.

## Steps to the project.

### Part 1: Data Preparation
1. Load the data
2. Inspect the data
3. Handle Misssing values in the data
4. Convert the data type

### Part 2: Exploratory Data Analysis
1. Create plots to reveal and underlying distribution and relationship between data

### Part 3: Feature Engineering
1. Extract Features
2. Encode Categorical Features


### Part 4: Machine Learing
1. Prepare the data for modelling
2. Train the model
3. Evaluate the model
4. Hyper parameter tuning

### Part 5: Create a Dashboard using Streamlit
1. Install the streamlit application
2. Create Streanlit application
3. Run the Applications
